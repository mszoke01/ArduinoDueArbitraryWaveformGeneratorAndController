INO code development improvements to ArduinoDueArbitraryWaveformGeneratorAndController Version 1.2.
These include addition of User Defined Equation code modifications which builds upon and increases functionality with custom wave shapes and control using Serial Monitor. There are now 7 wave shapes included (sine, triangle, arbitrary, staircase, square root, ring modulator and pseudo noise) each with variables including a sample and hold function capability which can be changed within the Serial Monitor. Changing variables and functions will modify the wave shape.
